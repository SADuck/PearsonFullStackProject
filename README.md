Quick Start:

•	To start the application, first you will need to use the node package manager to download the following dependencies in the react project (Copy and paste into the terminal):

o	npm install axios

o	npm install cors

o	npm install date-fns

o	npm install fs

o	npm install http

o	npm install prop-types

o	npm install react-big-calendar

o	npm install react-datepicker

o	npm install react-helmet

o	npm install react-router-dom

o	npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components

o	npm install @mui/x-charts

o	npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

	Also don’t forget to download the express.js for the server-side files (the backend servers in the server-side folder)

•	If you have any problem with any module, React will notify you of the error, and you could just simply do the following: write in the terminal npm install “module name” and it will be downloaded.

•	After downloading the necessary dependencies, we have a few more steps to follow:

o	First, we open the react server through opening a CMD terminal in the Dern-Support file directory and with the CMD terminal we will run the following command: npm start.

o	After opening the react server, you will have to open the backend servers.

	First navigate to the server-side folder in the dern-support folder. Then when inside the folder, open 3 CMD windows with the directory of the server-side folder and in these windows.

	Run the following Commands:

•	node server.js

•	node serverInventory.js

•	node serverSubmitRequest.js

	Each of these commands should be in a different window of the cmd windows.

•	And that’s how to run the Full stack solution
